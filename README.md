Air quality has become a rising factor of concern in India due to massive urbanization and rapid development of cities. Most metropolitan and industrial cities in India such as Delhi suffer from poor air quality which has adverse effects on health and quality of life. Air Quality Index (AQI) is a numeric measure used to describe the quality of air in a particular location. Bad Air quality can cause major health problems such as cardiovascular diseases, Reduction of lung function, aggravation of conditions such as breathing problems and Asthma, Allergic reactions, and even pregnancy complications. 
In this research, we studied air quality and the parameters associated with it extensively to develop the best Machine Learning (ML) model to AQI. Various ML models such as random forests, decision trees, support vector machines and k-nearest neighbors, ridge regression, XGBoost, elastic net regression, and neural network regression. The research has strategically employed Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies with the help of prominent tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) which has been instrumental in helping us extract a concise feature set with equivalent outputs when compared to the full feature set. The research deploys 10 ML models. The highest accuracies were achieved via, 95% for random forests, 95% for XGBoost, 90% for K-NN, 91% for K-NN.
